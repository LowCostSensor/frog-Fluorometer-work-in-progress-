This FROG (Fluorescence Real-time Observation Gatherer)sensor measures chlorophyll and humic substances in water using LEDs and a light-dependent resistor (LDR). It converts light intensity readings into concentration values (ppb), logs data locally to an SD card for offline storage, and uploads measurements to ThingSpeak over Wi-Fi for remote monitoring. The device runs automatic measurements at regular intervals. Possible improvements are: include GSM connectivity for field deployment and a waterproof enclosure for long-term water exposure.
